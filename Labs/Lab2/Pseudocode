function isAnagram(s, t):
    if length of s is not equal to length of t:
        return false

    create a hash map

    for each character c in s:
        increment the count of c in the hash map

    for each character c in t:
        if c does not exist in the hash map or its count is 0:
            return false
        else:
            decrement the count of c in the hash map

    return true
