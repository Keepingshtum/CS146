### P-Class Problems
solvable in polynomial time, ex: what we have done in class thus far, sorting, searching, tree traversal, BFS, DFS, topological sort, MSTs, etc...

### NP-Class Problems
 Problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time ;  P problems are a subset of NP problems.

### NP-Complete
a problem is NP-Complete if it...
- is in NP
- Every problem in NP can be reduced to it.
Reduction: transforming a problem into an existing algorithm for the solution.

### If P = NP
- Cryptography will change.
- We can solve all NP problems

### If P != NP
- problems are  difficult.
- we can stop spending time figuring if P = NP
