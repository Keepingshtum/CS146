Asymptotic Notation

Big-O (O): Represents upper bound of an algorithm's runtime
Big-Omega (Ω): Represents lower bound of an algorithm's runtime
Theta (Θ): Represents both upper and lower bounds

Finding Big-O, Omega, Theta

Example: f(n) = 10n + 100

O(n), Ω(n), Θ(n)


Look at highest degree terms to approximate
Pick tightest bound possible

Best, Worst, Average Cases

Linear Search example

Best Case: O(1), item at start
Worst Case: O(n), item at end
Average Case: O(n), sum(1...n)/n = (n+1)/2
