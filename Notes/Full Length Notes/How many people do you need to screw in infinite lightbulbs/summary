Growth of Functions

Visualizing growth rates of different math functions: y=x (linear), y=x^2 (quadratic), y=x^3 (cubic)
Example functions and analyzing their growth rates:
sumArray with one loop: Linear O(n) growth
Nested loops: Quadratic O(n^2) growth
Multiple separate loops: Still linear O(n) growth
Loop where i grows exponentially (i=i*2): Logarithmic O(log n) growth
Loop where i grows faster than exponential: O(sqrt(n)) growth
Each additional nested loop increases the order of growth by a factor of n
But multiple separate loops don't necessarily increase order of growth
Analyzing Growth Rates
Break down function into components
Count number of times each component executes, express as polynomial
Identify highest degree term to get overall order of growth
