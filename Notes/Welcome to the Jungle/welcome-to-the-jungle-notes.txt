Binary Search Trees:
  Good for searching (hmmm)
  Traversal:
    Left -> lesser than parent, Right -> greater than parent
    2 cases: element is there, or it isn’t there and we have to traverse the tree
    Inorder traversal: LNR
    Preorder: NLR
    Postorder: LRN
  Insertion:
    Can have duplicate values:
      Approach 1: Add duplicate element as right/left child (use right for stability during in-order traversal)
      Approach 2: Augment with counts
  Deletion:
    For leaf nodes, just traverse to node and delete it
    For branch nodes, you have to find the smallest value greater than the node you’re deleting to preserve BST property properly:
      Go to right child of node you’re deleting, then go down left children until no left children left, then swap it in
    Best Theta(1), avg Theta(logn), Worst Theta(n) for search, insert, delete (but best case for insertion is rare, only if inserting first value iirc)
    Traversal worst case collapses when BST is skewed (just one long chain of just right and left subchildren)
