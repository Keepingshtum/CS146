The goal of this problem is to determine if a given version number is considered bad or good based on a certain criterion.
The main idea is to use a simple comparison to check if the given version number is greater than or equal to a predefined bad version number.
Here's the concept using the main parts of the code:
In Java:
public static boolean isBadVersion(int version) {
    int bad = 4;
    if (version >= bad) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

public static void checkVersion(int version) {
    if (isBadVersion(version)) {
        System.out.println("Version " + version + " is considered bad.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Version " + version + " is considered good.");
    }
}
In Python:
def isBadVersion(version):
    bad = 4
    if version >= bad:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def checkVersion(version):
    if isBadVersion(version):
        print("Version {} is considered bad.".format(version))
    else:
        print("Version {} is considered good.".format(version))
In this part, we define the isBadVersion method ( in Python) that takes a version number (version) as input. It compares the given version number with a predefined bad version number (bad).
If the given version number is greater than or equal to the bad version number, the method returns true (or True in Python), indicating that the version is considered bad.
If the given version number is less than the bad version number, the method returns false (or False in Python), indicating that the version is considered good.
We also define the checkVersion method ( in Python) that takes a version number as input. It calls the isBadVersion method to determine if the version is bad or good.
If the version is bad, it prints a message indicating that the version is considered bad.
If the version is good, it prints a message indicating that the version is considered good.
In the main method ( Python code), we prompt the user to enter a version number to check. We then call the checkVersion method with the entered version number to determine if it is bad or good and print the corresponding message.
The main idea is to use a simple comparison to check if the given version number is greater than or equal to a predefined bad version number. This allows us to determine if a version is considered bad or good based on the comparison result.
