### hw 8 hashset plain english approach

we would count the letters in a string, that has one duplicate, with that count we can multiply it by 2 and add 1 , since 1 non-duplicate is acceptable. A set would help us count the letters that have a duplicate. 

check if the string is null , 
create a hashset, and counter
go through the string and see if the letters within the string are already in the hashset, if they are then remove it and increment count, if not thne add it onto the hashset, return the count (using the property of the palindromes)
