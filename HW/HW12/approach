The goal of this problem is to find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses in a village. Each house can either be connected to a well or to another house that is already connected to a water source. The cost of connecting a house to a well or to another house is given.
The main idea is to use a minimum spanning tree algorithm, specifically Kruskal's algorithm, along with a disjoint set data structure to find the minimum cost connections.
Here's a simplified explanation of the concept using the main parts of the code:
In Python:
def minCostToSupplyWater(n, wells, pipes):
    costs = []
    for i, cost in enumerate(wells):
        costs.append((cost, 0, i + 1))
    for house1, house2, cost in pipes:
        costs.append((cost, house1, house2))
    costs.sort()
    
    total_cost = 0
    dsu = DisjointSet(n + 1)
    for cost, house1, house2 in costs:
        if dsu.union(house1, house2):
            total_cost += cost
    
    return total_cost
In Java:
public int minCostToSupplyWater(int n, int[] wells, int[][] pipes) {
    List<int[]> allPipes = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] pipe : pipes) {
        allPipes.add(pipe);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        allPipes.add(new int[]{0, i + 1, wells[i]});
    }
    Collections.sort(allPipes, (a, b) -> a[2] - b[2]);
    
    int[] parent = new int[n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    int minCost = 0;
    for (int[] pipe : allPipes) {
        int u = find(parent, pipe[0]);
        int v = find(parent, pipe[1]);
        if (u != v) {
            parent[u] = v;
            minCost += pipe[2];
        }
    }
    
    return minCost;
}
In this part, we create a list (costs in Python, allPipes in Java) to store all the possible connections, including the connections from each house to a well and the connections between houses.
We add the cost of connecting each house to a well as a tuple ((cost, 0, i + 1) in Python) or an array ({0, i + 1, wells[i]} in Java), where 0 represents the virtual node for wells, i + 1 represents the house, and wells[i] represents the cost of connecting the house to a well.
We also add the cost of connecting two houses as a tuple ((cost, house1, house2) in Python) or an array ({house1, house2, cost} in Java), where house1 and house2 represent the houses, and cost represents the cost of connecting them.
We sort the list of connections based on their costs in ascending order.
We initialize a disjoint set data structure (DisjointSet in Python, parent array in Java) to keep track of the connected components.
We iterate over the sorted list of connections. For each connection, we find the roots of the sets that the two houses belong to using the find function.
If the roots are different, it means the houses are not already connected, so we perform a union operation to merge the sets and add the cost of the connection to the total cost (total_cost in Python, minCost in Java).
Finally, we return the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.
The main idea is to use Kruskal's algorithm to build a minimum spanning tree by considering the connections in ascending order of their costs. The disjoint set data structure helps in efficiently tracking the connected components and avoiding cycles.
