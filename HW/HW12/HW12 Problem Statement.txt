There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1] (note the -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes where each pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj] represents the cost to connect house1j and house2j together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs.

Return the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Constraints:

    2 <= n <= 104
    wells.length == n
    0 <= wells[i] <= 105
    1 <= pipes.length <= 104
    pipes[j].length == 3
    1 <= house1j, house2j <= n
    0 <= costj <= 105
    house1j != house2j
