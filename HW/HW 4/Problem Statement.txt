Problem 1:
We have discussed insertion sort as an algorithm. Now that we know how to analyze algorithms AND asymptotic notation, let's revisit Insertion Sort!

You may refer to class slides/ online resources to refresh your memory on the insertion sort algorithm. 

For insertion sort, what is the 

Best Case
Average Case
Worst Case
Time complexity? Show your reasoning and work. 

 

Problem 2:
Below is the pseudocode to perform matrix multiplication that we discussed in HW3. 

MATRIX_MULTIPLY(A, B): 
  if columns(A) ≠ rows(B): 
    raise ValueError("Matrix multiplication is not defined.") 

  rows_A ← number of rows in A 
  cols_A ← number of columns in A 
  cols_B ← number of columns in B 
  result ← matrix of size rows_A x cols_B filled with zeros 

  for i from 1 to rows_A do: 
    for j from 1 to cols_B do: 
    sum ← 0 
      for k from 1 to cols_A do: 
        sum ← sum + A[i][k] * B[k][j] 
      result[i][j] ← sum return result
For the above pseudocode, what is the 

Best Case
Average Case
Worst Case
Time complexity? Show your reasoning and work.
