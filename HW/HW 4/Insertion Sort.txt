Insertion Sort Time Complexity

Pseudo Code:
def insertionSort (arr)                        // size of array = n
  int i = 1                                    // 1 time
  while (i < arr.length)                       // n times 
    int j = i                                  // n times
    while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]        // n^2 times
      swap arr[j - 1] and arr[j]               // n^2 times
      j--                                      // n^2 times
    i++                                        // n times
  
The growth of insertion sort is quadratic. 
The nested while loops mean that the function grows at quadratic rate.

Best Case Scenario
Array is already sorted
The nested while loop on line 8 will only trigger once because arr[j-1] will never be greater than arr[j]
O(n)
Ω(n)
Θ(n)

Worst Case Scenario
Array is in reverse order, therefore the while loop will have to loop for the full range
O(n^2)
Ω(n^2)
Θ(n^2)

Average Case Scenario
Array is shuffled in random order
O(n^2)
Ω(n^2)
Θ(n^2)
