Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

This time, your problem has additional details:

Constraints:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
The order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
