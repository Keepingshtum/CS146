Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All values are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.
