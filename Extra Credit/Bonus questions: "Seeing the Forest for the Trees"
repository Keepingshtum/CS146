This assignment is going to be a longer, more open-ended one! As a result, you get double the amount of time to work on this assignment, and double the extra credit for a submission!

We've looked at one example of self-balancing trees, i.e. Red-Black Trees. We briefly discussed AVL Trees and B Trees as well. 

In Java OR Python, try implementing a Red-Black or AVL Tree or BTree. Remember to support all basic operations (Traversal, Insertion, Deletion)
Ideally, you would want to do all three, and compare how they each behave, etc. You can also look up their respective Wikipedia pages for pseudocode, or try and implement them yourself from scratch. 
Research these data structures further, and explain your findings in a markdown/pdf file. You may wish to look at real-life applications, advantages, shortcomings, etc.
