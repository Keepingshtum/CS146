Now that we've looked at graph representations, it's time to dive deeper!

Given an adjacency list, how can you convert it to an adjacency matrix? 
Given an adjacency matrix, how can you convert it to an adjacency list? 
Given a directed graph, how can you reverse the direction of each edge? 
To receive extra credit, you must: 

Answer all three questions with AT LEAST pseudocode and an explanation.
If you're feeling brave, try and implement the above three as functions in Java OR Python! (Remember, more effort means higher chances of double/triple extra credit!) 
In the same folder, have a markdown/pdf/text file explaining your findings.
