A Fibonacci number is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence typically begins as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Write a function to compute the nth Fibonacci number, in both Java and Python. 

CONSTRAINT:
Your implementation has to be optimized. Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n).
