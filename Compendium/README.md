This is the "Compendium", a sorta wiki-like collection of all of the concepts covered in the CS 146 - Data Structures and Algorithms course with Professor Anant Shukla. This is meant not only to be referred back to for the context of studying in the final, but created to be helpful to refer back to in other classes and non-academic settings where appropriate. As such, it is sorted not by when we covered the topics, but by the actual topic. 

Feedback, additions, and corrections are encouraged as this is a fairly deep undertaking for one person (me) to complete in a timely manner, although please try and stick to the slides for information (as that is what is most imperative to know), although adding pictures and minutae from other sources is also acceptable if it aids in understanding of the main content.

Information will attempt to be language neutral. Do note that I have a bias towards Java and am far more familiar in the intricacies of the data structures and whatnot in that language. Some data structures may include methods/functions in one or both languages, some algorithms may have implementations in one or both languages. Other languages are welcome but are not the the focus of this project.

# Formatting Suggestions/Soft Requirements
I currently use a format in which I 

1. Provide a disclaimer at the top notifying the reader of any potential topics they may need to review in order to properly understand the given topic. A file on RB trees would mention the reader should be comfortable with BSTs (and the BST file should include a disclaimer letting the reader know they should be well versed in trees). 
2. Have an "intuitroduction" (intuition introduction!) at the start to introduce and give intuition to the topic. Rather than jumping right into the Dijkstra's algorithm, it may be a good idea to explain *what* the problem we're trying to solve is and even the general common-sense intuition before we even dive into pseudo-code or specific data structures.
3. Provide clear titles to each section to allow the discerning reader to navigate to the more substantive areas in a simple manner.
4. Explain the topics in a textbook-like format rather than just notes. If the reader is looking for the bullet points, the notes section in this repo is the right resource for them. We're here to hammer nails, not thread screws :)

If you have a better idea on how to properly format or ease readers in, that's fine too. If not, I suggest you stick to these guidelines in order to create a sense of uniformity for reader's comfort.
