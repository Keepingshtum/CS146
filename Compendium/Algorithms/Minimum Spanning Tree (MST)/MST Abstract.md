This is just to discuss the MST problem to review for Prim's and Kruskal's (so it doesn't take up space in both). To find out how to solve an MST, navigate to the Prim's or Boruvka's section in this folder.

## MST Problem
An important problem when it comes to graphs is the question of how to connect every node with the least possible total cost.

The intuition for this problem is that you want to have cheap paths and drop expensive paths. You can connect nodes through multiple cheap paths rather than a single expensive path.

There are 3 main algorithms to solve this problem: Prim's, Kruskal's, and Boruvka's algorithm. You only need to worry about the former two.
