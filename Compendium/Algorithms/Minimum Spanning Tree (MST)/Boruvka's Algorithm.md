# Quick Outline:
Boruvka's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph. It works by repeatedly adding the cheapest edge from one node to another,eventually connecting all node into a single spanning tree.

# Simple Way of Looking at it/Example:

Imagine you are connecting several isolated villages with roads at the lowest possible cost. Boruvka's Algorithm helps you achieve this by progressively adding the cheapest roads between the villages until all villages are connected.

# Assumptions of Boruvka's Algorithm:
The algorithm operates under the assumption that the graph is connected and weighted. It repeatedly adds the cheapest edge from each component, merging components until only one remains.

# Each Part of Boruvka's Algorithm in Detail:
Initialization: Start with each vertex as a separate component

Find Cheapest Edges: For each component find the cheapest edge connecting it to a different component

Add Cheapest Edges: Add all the cheapest edges found in the previous step to the MST

Merge Components: Merge the components connected by the added edges

Repeat: Repeat the process until there is only one component remaining, which is the MST


# Key Steps in Boruvka's Algorithm:
Initialize Components: Treat each vertex as a separate component

Identify Cheapest Edges: For each component identify the cheapest edge connecting it to another component

Merge Components: Add the identified edges to the MST and merge the connected components

Repeat: Continue identifying and adding the cheapest edges until a single component (the MST) is formed


# Pseudocode: (NOT MY CODE)
function boruvkasAlgorithm(graph) is
    MST := empty set
    components := array where each vertex is its own component
    while number of components > 1 do
        cheapestEdge := array of size number of components, initialized to None
        for each edge (u, v) in graph do
            component_u := findComponent(u)
            component_v := findComponent(v)
            if component_u != component_v then
                if cheapestEdge[component_u] is None or edge.weight < cheapestEdge[component_u].weight then
                    cheapestEdge[component_u] := edge
                if cheapestEdge[component_v] is None or edge.weight < cheapestEdge[component_v].weight then
                    cheapestEdge[component_v] := edge
        for each edge in cheapestEdge do
            if edge is not None then
                u, v := edge.vertices
                if findComponent(u) != findComponent(v) then
                    add edge to MST
                    mergeComponents(u, v)
    return MST


# Considerations When Using Boruvka's Algorithm:
Initial Component Identification: Initially, each vertex is considered its own component.

Cheapest Edge Selection: It is crucial to correctly identify and select the cheapest edges connecting different components.

Merging Components: Properly merging components ensures the correct formation of the MST.

Algorithm Efficiency: Boruvka's Algorithm is efficient 

# Time Complexity:
O(E log V) -  where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

# Space Complexity:
O(V + E) - for storing the graph and component information.
