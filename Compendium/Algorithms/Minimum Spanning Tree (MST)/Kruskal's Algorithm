## Kruskal's Process
Kruskal's essentially relies of picking least cost edges that connect new nodes until you have connected all of them. It goes a little like this: 

1. Pick the minimum weight edge and add it to our MST tree soln.
2. Do this again and again, ignoring it if it connected two nodes that already exist in our MST tree soln
3. When you have collected all nodes to the MST, you can terminate the loop and your MST is done.

This is implemented using a disjoint set and uses union-find. 

The time complexity of this is **O(ElogE)**.
